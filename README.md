# Market Basket Analysis Project (Python)

## Overview

Welcome to the Market Basket Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase patterns to discover interesting associations between products. Market Basket Analysis is a powerful technique in data mining and is widely used in retail and e-commerce for optimizing product placements, cross-selling, and marketing strategies.

## Project Description

### Goal
The primary goal of this project is to uncover meaningful associations between products. By understanding which products are frequently purchased together, we can make informed decisions to enhance the shopping experience and increase revenue.

### Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing transactional data, capturing the items purchased by customers over a certain period. The dataset is sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayan15/market-basket-dataset). Same available above (market_basket_dataset.csv).

### Methodology
Market Basket Analysis is performed using the Apriori algorithm, a classic algorithm in association rule mining. The algorithm identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on support, confidence, and lift metrics.
